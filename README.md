# Artifact Evaluation


## 1. Environment Preparation
JDK 1.7, Python 3+, Maven 3+


## 2. Experiment Reproduction
In the directory `scripts/`, each bash script (i.e., `Table-*.sh`) runs experiments and logs results which are relevant to the tables in the paper. 
For example, executing the script `Table-5.sh` can collecting and reporting the results in Table-5; the generated results are in the file `Table-5.csv` in the directory `scripts/final-results/`.

```sh
$ cd scripts
$ ./Table-5.sh
```
In detail, `Table-5.sh`, for each subject in Defect4J-1.2.0, it first runs spectrum, Muse, Metallaxis, MCBFL and ProFL techniques via executing `MBFL.py`;
secondly, it merges the results of each subject via executing `full-log.py`; lastly, it executes `table5.py` to print the results in the form of table and log them in the `scripts/final-results/` directory.

Similarly, all the data in the paper can be reproduced by executing relevant `Table-*.sh` script code.


## 3. Tool
ProFL has been implemented as a fully automated Maven plugin, 
which is integrated on the latest byte code program repair tool PraPR. 
To apply ProFL on any Java project,  one only needs to 
(1) install ProFL to the local maven repository; 
(2) configure ProFL in the pom.xml of the target subject; 
(3) execute ProFL via maven command.





### 3.1 Install ProFL
To install the ProFL into the local maven repository. 

```sh
$ cd tool/proFL
$ mvn clean install -Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2
```

### 3.2 Configure ProFL
Insert the following code into the `pom.xml` of the target project (already inserted for the three example projects).


```xml
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.mudebug</groupId>
	<artifactId>prapr-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>2.0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
</plugin>
```


### 3.3 Execute ProFL
Three examples(i.e., Lang-26, Chart-20, and Time-19) are provided.
Passing the example name to the python script `run-example.py` can execute ProFL for the example.

For example, to execute ProFL on Lang-26 with following instructions.

```sh
$ cd tool/examples
$ python run-example.py Lang-26
```

It would first execute maven compile and test tasks on the project
and then execute ProFL as a maven plugin.

### 3.4 ProFL Reports
The final reports of ProFL are in the directory of the `target/prapr-reports/*YYMMDD*/`.
`profl.log` is the fault localization rank list generated by ProFL;
`sbfl.log` is the fault localization rank list generated by spectrum-based fault localization;

We summarize the expected execution information of three examples in the following.

Example Name | Bug Method | Ranked by Spectrum | Ranked by ProFL |  Execution Time|
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Lang-17 | format | 17 | 1 | < 2 min|
Chart-20|ValueMarker.init | 5 | 1 | < 2min|
Time-19| getOffsetFromLocal |0| 1 | < 2min|
